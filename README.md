# X-Ray-Spectroscopy-Analysis

#A series of Macros that use Cern's Root Data Analysis Framework to plot and analyze X-Ray spectroscopic data. 

#Files in cnf_converter are for converting CNF files from Canberras Gamma Aquisition and Analysis. This code most likely works for any .CNF file.

#Put .CNF file in the cnf_converter directory and use command cnf2txt <File.CNF> <output_file_name>. where Fle.cnf is the file you want to convert and output_file_name is the name of the file that will be readable. 


#Analysis folder holds C++ macros using CERNs ROOT to analyze and plot X-Ray Spectroscopy data.
